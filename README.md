# BkpPkgList
Backup list of packages

This just gets all your installed packages from pacman (you can change it to use your own package manager), put all their names into one file, compares it against your old file of installed packages, and combines them into one file, sorted, with duplicates removed.
I just use this with a cron job so that I keep a running list of all the packages I've every had installed. You're free to use it too, no credit necessary cause it's so simple and I'm sure a million other people have made basically this same script.
